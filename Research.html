Using metamorphic testing to improve the quality of tags in OpenStreetMap. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering. 2022. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9729566" class="text-primary">Electronic Edition</a>.<br><br>Abstract. We present a metamorphic testing approach to validate the information included in OpenStreetMap, a collaborative effort to produce a free map of the world. We focus on the quality of the tags storing the information about the elements of the map. We identified metamorphic relations with the potential to detect different types of tagging errors. In particular, we carefully designed mechanisms to automatically generate follow-up inputs, a fundamental component in the successful application of a metamorphic testing approach. The intrinsic nature of automatically analysing tags implies that we will detect real errors but some false positives as well. In order to obtain a good trade-off between real errors and false positives, we introduce thresholds. Our MRs will raise an error associated with a certain value if, depending on the nature of the MR, we have a certain number of elements (not) fulfilling a given condition. In order to evaluate the goodness and versatility of our framework, we chose four cities in different continents with the goal of analysing very heterogeneous contributors adding information in different languages. The application of this framework to the analysis<br>of the chosen cities revealed errors in all of them and in all the considered categories. In addition, around 66% of the errors found by our MRs in the analysed areas have not been previously reported by Osmose, the de facto standard OSM error checker.<br><br>130. Jesús M.

The Retrieval of Social Network Data for Points-of-Interest in OpenStreetMap. Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences volume 11, Article number: 10 (2021). <a href="http://hcisj.com/articles/issue_view.php?wr_id=317&amp;page=2" class="text-primary">Electronic Edition.</a><br><br>Abstract.&nbsp;OpenStreetMap is a volunteered geographic information system aimed at creating a free editable map of the world. One of the central elements of OpenStreetMap is the point-of-interest (POI). OpenStreetMap’s contributors label POIs with information about them, including their name, type, address, etc. However, to use OpenStreetMap for touristic purposes, POIs should be annotated with useful information for visitors. Recently, our group developed XOSM, a query language and visualization tool for OpenStreetMap. This paper describes how to integrate social network queries into the XOSM query language. As a consequence of such integration, XOSM enables the definition and visualization of queries in which social network data are retrieved for POIs. XOSM social network queries serve to analyze the characteristics and relevance of POIs by visualizing Twitter and YouTube data. XOSM APIs have been built on top of the social network APIs to map XOSM POIs to social network data. To obtain better accuracy and reduce noise in the matching of OpenStreetMap POIs and social network data, some improvements are proposed. In particular, this paper suggests restricting the search space of the APIs by using the city name and the type of POI and then filtering the results of the APIs using the Levenshtein distance, examines the advantages of such improvements, and provides benchmarks that validate the proposal.<a href="http://hcisj.com/articles/issue_view.php?wr_id=317&amp;page=2" class="text-primary"><br></a><br>126.&nbsp;Jesús M.Almendros-Jiménez, Antonio Becerra-Terón. Discovery and diagnosis of wrong SPARQL queries with ontology and constraint reasoning. Expert Systems with Applications<br>Volume 165, 1 March 2021, 113772. 2021. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417420305960?via%3Dihub" class="text-primary">Electronic Edition</a>.<br><br>Abstract.&nbsp;The discovery and diagnosis of wrong queries in database query languages have gained more attention in recent years. While for imperative languages well-known and mature debugging tools exist, the case of database query languages has traditionally attracted less attention. SPARQL is a database query language proposed for the retrieval of information in Semantic Web resources. RDF and OWL are standardized formats for representing Semantic Web information, and SPARQL acts on RDF/OWL resources allowing to retrieve answers of user’s queries. In spite of the SPARQL apparent simplicity, the number of mistakes a user can make in queries can be high and their detection, localization, and correction can be difficult to carry out. Wrong queries have as consequence most of the times empty answers, but also wrong and missing (expected but not found) answers. In this paper we present two ontology and constraint reasoning based methods for the discovery and diagnosis of wrong queries in SPARQL. The first method is used for detecting wrongly typed and unsatisfiable queries. The second method is used for detecting mismatching between user intention and queries, reporting incomplete, faulty queries as well as counterexamples. We formally define the above concepts and a list of examples to illustrate the methods is shown. A Web online tool has been developed to analyze SPARQL queries according to the proposed methods.<br><br>125.&nbsp;Jesús M.Almendros-Jiménez, Antonio Becerra-Terón, Mercedes G.Merayo, Manuel Núñez. Metamorphic testing of OpenStreetMap. Information and Software Technology, Volume 138, October 2021, 106631 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921000987?via%3Dihub" class="text-primary">Electronic Edition</a><br><br>Abstract.&nbsp;Context: OpenStreetMap represents a collaborative effort of many different and unrelated users to create a free map of the world. Although contributors follow some general guidelines, unsupervised additions are prone to include erroneous information. Unfortunately, it is impossible to automatically detect most of these issues because there does not exist an oracle to evaluate whether the information is correct or not. Metamorphic testing has shown to be very useful in assessing the correctness of very heterogeneous artifacts when oracles are not available. Objective: The main goal of our work is to provide a (fully implemented) framework, based on metamorphic testing, that will support the analysis of the information provided in OpenStreetMap with the goal of detecting faulty information. Method:<br>We defined a general metamorphic testing framework to deal with OpenStreetMap. We identified a set of good metamorphic relations. In order to have as much automation as possible, we paid special attention to the automatic selection of follow-up inputs because they are fundamental to diminish manual testing. In order to assess the usefulness of our framework, we applied it to analyze maps of four cities in different continents. The rationale is that we would be dealing with different problems created by different contributors. Results:<br>We obtained experimental evidence that shows the potential value of our framework. The application of our framework to the analysis of the chosen cities revealed errors in all of them and in all the considered categories. Conclusion: The experiments showed the usefulness of our framework to identify potential issues in the information appearing in OpenStreetMap. Although our metamorphic relations are very helpful, future users of the framework might identify other relations to deal with specific situations not covered by our relations. Since we provide a general pattern to define metamorphic relations, it is relatively easy to extend the existing framework. In particular, since all our metamorphic relations are implemented and the code is freely available, users have a pattern to implement new relations.<br><br>124.&nbsp;Jesús M.

In recent years, Open Street Map (OSM) has evolved into a highly popular geospatial system. The key of success of OSM is that OSM is open to absolutely everyone. OSM is not dependent on any one government, company, university, or international organization. OSM is based on crowdsourcing, in which users collaborate to collect spatial data of urban and rural areas on the earth. With the arising of Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative, and more concretely with Linked Geo Open Data (LGOD), many Web resources have been made available to everyone, providing geo-located datasets. In this paper a framework, called XOSM (XQuery for OpenStreetMap), for integrating and querying OSM and LGOD resources is presented. The framework is equipped with a Web tool and a rich XQuery-based library, enabling the definition of queries combining OSM layers and layers created from LGOD resources (KML, GeoJSON, CSV and RDF (and also XML)). The framework also provides an API to execute XQuery queries using the library.<br><br>117. Jesús M. Almendros-Jiménez, Antonio Becerra-Terón, Gines Moreno.

Software Testing, Verification and Reliability Journal, January-March, Willey InterScience,  2017. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stvr.1625/abstract">Electronic Edition</a>.<br><br>Abstract: Property-based testing has gained popularity in recent years in many areas of software development. The specification of assertions/properties helps to understand the semantics of pieces of code and, in modern programming environments, it can serve to test the program behavior. In this paper an XQuery property- based testing tool is presented which enables to automatically test XQuery programs. The tool is able to systematically generate XML instances (i.e., test cases) from a given XML schema, and to filter XML instances with input properties specified by the programmer. Additionally, the tool automatically checks output (respectively, input-output) properties in each output instance (respectively, each pair of input-output instances). The tool is able to report whether the XQuery program passes the test, that is, if all the test cases satisfy the (input-)output property, as well as the number of test cases used for testing. In addition, if the XQuery program fails the test, the tool shows counterexamples found in the test cases. Properties are specified with XQuery Boolean functions, and the testing tool has been implemented in XQuery. Additionally, an XQuery path validation tool is presented. This tool is able to detect wrong paths in XQuery expressions. The path validation tool takes as input an XML Schema and it reports those paths on the XQuery program that do not match the XML Schema. The path validation tool is a complement to the testing tool rejecting XQuery programs that do not conform to the XML Schema. The path validation tool has been also implemented in XQuery. Finally, a Web tool has been developed enabling to test and validate XQuery programs.<br><br>107.Jesús M. Almendros-Jiménez, Antonio Becerra-Terón and Alfredo Cuzzocrea.

Debugging while Interpreting Fuzzy XPath Queries. FUZZ-IEEE 2016: The 2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 2016. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7737692/">Electronic Edition</a>.<br><br>Abstract. We have recently introduced “dynamic thresholding” techniques into our debugger of XPath queries which produces a set of correct XPath expressions with better chance degrees for retrieving answers from large XML files in a very efficient way. In this paper we focus on a new command called DEBIN intended to automatically interpret all these correct queries for the retrieval of their answers. The interest of the new command resides in the fact that users can retrieve now new information not necessarily reported by the execution of their initial queries, thus collecting useful novel answers (very often accompanied with a greater “retrieval status value” or satisfaction degree) associated to correct queries which slightly deviate from the original ones. In this paper we justify why, apart for automatically removing redundant solutions and sorting them, the use of appropriate filters seems to be mandatory when managing queries with the DEBIN command, in order to maintain efficiency and to avoid the generation of useless knowledge, since both the set of correct queries produced by the debugging process, as well as the set of answers obtained after interpreting them, can be enormous. Additionally, we justify why DEBIN should retrieve answers of correct queries, with worse chance degree but better satisfaction degree.<br><br>101. Jesús M. Almendros-Jiménez and Antonio Becerra.

Volunteered geographic information (VGI) makes available a very large resource of geographic data. The exploitation of data coming from such resources requires an additional effort in the form of tools and effective processing techniques. One of the most established VGI is Open Street Map (OSM) offering data of urban and rural maps from the earth. In this paper we present a library for querying OSM with XQuery. This library is based on the well-known spatial operators defined by Clementini and Egenhofer, providing a repertoire of XQuery functions which encapsulate the search on the XML document representing a layer of OSM, and make the definition of queries on top of OSM layers easy. In essence, the library is equipped with a set of OSM Operators for OSM elements which, in combination with Higher Order facilities of XQuery, facilitates the composition of queries and the definition of keyword based search geo-localized queries. OSM data are indexed by an R-tree structure, in which OSM elements are enclosed by Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs), in order to get shorter answer time.<br><br>100.Jesús M.

Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems, 11th International Conference, HAIS 2016, LNCS 9648, pp. 14-26, 2016. <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-32034-2_2">Electronic Edition</a>.<br><br>Abstract. In this paper we introduce and experimentally assess SemSynX, a novel technique for supporting similarity analysis of XML data via semantic and syntactic heterogeneity/homogeneity detection. Given two XML trees, SemSynX retrieves a list of semantic and syntactic heterogeneity/homogeneity matches of objects (i.e., elements, values, tags, attributes) occurring in certain paths of the trees. A local score that takes into account the path and value similarity is given for each heterogeneity/homogeneity found. A global score that summarizes the number of equal matches as well as the local scores globally is also provided. The proposed technique is highly customizable, and it permits the specification of thresholds for the requested degree of similarity for paths and values as well as for the degree of relevance for path and value matching. It thus makes possible to “adjust” the similarity analysis depending on the nature of the input XML trees. SemSynX has been implemented in terms of a XQuery library, as to enhance interoperability with other XML processing tools. To complete our analytical contributions, a comprehensive experimental assessment and evaluation of SemSynX over several classes of XML documents is provided.<br><br>99.Jesús M.

In this paper we present a tool for the automatic validation of XQuery programs. Firstly, the tool is able to detect wrong paths in XQuery expressions with respect to an XML Schema. Secondly, it makes possible the specification of in- put and output properties, as well as input-output properties (i.e., properties relating input and output data) of programs. Thirdly, the tool is able to filter randomly generated test cases with input properties, as well as to test output and input-output properties on randomly generated test cases and the corresponding output. It reports counterexamples when output or input-output properties are not satisfied. The tool has been implemented as an XQuery library which can be used from any XQuery interpreter. <br><br>98.E.

This study presents a different approach to classification of Mesoscale Oceanic Structures (MOS) present in the North West African Area, based on their location. The main improvement stems from the partition of this area in four large zones perfectly differentiated by their morphological characteristics, with attention to seafloor topography and coastal relief. This decomposition makes it easier to recognize structures under adverse conditions, basically the presence of clouds partly hiding them. This is observed particularly well in upwellings, which are usually very large structures with a different morphology and genesis in each zone. This approach not only improves classification of the upwellings, but also makes it possible to analyze changes in the MOS over time, improving prediction of its morphological evolution.<br><br>97.Jesús M.

The problem of supporting similarity analysis of XML data is a major problem in the data fusion research area. Several approaches have been proposed in literature, but lack of flexibility represents a hard challenge to be faced-off, especially in modern Cloud Computing environments. Inspired by this motivation, we propose SemSynX, a novel technique for supporting similarity analysis of XML data via semantic and syntactic heterogeneity/homogeneity detection. SemSynX retrieves several similarity scores over input XML documents, thus enabling flexible management and “customization” of similarity tools over XML data. In particular, the proposed technique is highly customizable, and it permits the specification of thresholds for the requested degree of similarity for paths and values as well as for the degree of relevance for path and value matching. Also, selection of paths and semantics-based comparison of label content are supported. It thus makes possible to “adjust” the similarity analysis depending on the nature of the input XML documents.<br><br>96.Jesús M. Almendros-Jiménez, Antonio Becerra-Terón and Manuel Torres. Aggregation Operators in Geospatial Queries for Open Street Map. On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems: OTM 2015 Conferences Proceedings.

One of the most stablished Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) systems is Open Street Map(OSM) offering data from the earth of urban and rural maps.

This library is based on the well-known spatial operators defined by Clementini and Egenhofer, providing a repertoire of XQuery functions which encapsulates the search on the XML document representing a layer of OSM, and makes the definition and composition of queries on top of OSM layers easier. This paper goes towards the incorporation in the library of aggregation operators in order to be able to express queries involving data summarization and ranking. A rich repertoire of aggregation operators has been defined which, in combination with the previously proposed library, makes possible to easily formulate aggregation-based queries. Also we present a Web-based tool, called XOSM (XQuery for Open Street Map), developed in our group, that uses the proposed library to query and visualize OSM data.<br><br>95. Jesús M.

In this paper we deal with propositional fuzzy formulae containing several propositional symbols linked with connectives defined in a lattice of truth degrees more complex than Bool. Instead of focusing on satisfiability (i.e., proving the existence of at least one model) as usually done in a SAT/SMT setting, our interest moves to the problem of finding the whole set of models (with a finite domain) for a given fuzzy formula. We re-use a previous method based on fuzzy logic programming where the formula is conceived as a goal whose derivation tree, provided by our FLOPER tool, contains on its leaves all the models of the original formula, together with other interpretations. Next, we use the ability of the FuzzyXPath tool (developed in our research group with FLOPER) for exploring these derivation trees once exported in XML format, in order to discover whether the formula is a tautology, satisfiable, or a contra- diction, thus reinforcing the bi-lateral synergies between FuzzyXPath and FLOPER.<br><br>94.

Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming, 85(20), Elsevier, pp. 332-366, 2016.  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352220815000565">Electronic Edition</a>.<br><br>Abstract: In this paper we present a model transformation language based on logic programming. The language, called PTL (Prolog based Transformation Language), can be considered as a hybrid language in which ATL (Atlas Trans- formation Language)-style rules are combined with logic rules for defining transformations. ATL-style rules are used to define mappings from source models to target models while logic rules are used as helpers. The implementation of PTL is based on the encoding of the ATL-style rules by Prolog rules. Thus, PTL makes use of Prolog as a transformation engine. We have provided a declarative semantics to PTL and proved the semantics equivalent to the encoded program. We have studied an encoding of OCL (Object Constraint Language) with Prolog goals in order to map ATL to PTL. Thus a subset of PTL can be considered equivalent to a subset of ATL. The pro- posed language can be also used for model validation, that is, for checking constraints on models and transformations. We have equipped our language with debugging and tracing capabilities which help developers to detect programming errors in PTL rules. Additionally, we have developed an Eclipse plugin for editing PTL programs, as well as for debugging, tracing and validation. Finally, we have evaluated the language with several transformation examples as well as tested the performance with large models.<br><br>91. Jesús M. Almendros-Jiménez and Antonio Becerra-Terón.

The ocean covers over 70 percent of the surface of our planet and plays a key role in the global climate. Most ocean circulation is mesoscale (scales of 50-500 km and 10-100 days), and the energy in mesoscale circulation is at least one order of magnitude greater than general circulation, therefore, the study of mesoscale oceanic structures is crucial to ocean dynamics, making it especially useful for analyzing global changes. The detection of Mesoscale Oceanic Structures (MOS), such as upwellings or eddies, from satellites images is significant for marine environmental studies and coastal resource management. In this paper we present an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) system which segments and classifies regions contained in SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua sensor satellite images into mesoscale oceanic structures. After color clustering and Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file processing, the OBIA system segments images and extracts image descriptors, producing primary regions. Then it merges regions, recalculating image descriptors for MOS identification and definition. First regions are labeled by a human-expert, who identifies MOS: upwellings, eddies, cool and warm eddies. Labeled regions are then classified by learning algorithms (i.e., Decision Tree, Bayesian Network, Artificial Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm and Near Neighbor Algorithm) from selected features. Finally, the OBIA system enables images to be queried from the user interface and retrieved by means of fuzzy descriptors and oceanic structures. We tested our system with images from the Canary Islands and the North West African coast.<br><br>87.Jesús Manuel Almendros-Jiménez. XQOWL: An Extension of XQuery for OWL Querying and Reasoning.

In practice, this degree is very low for some answers weakly accomplishing with the original query, and hence, they should not be computed in order to alleviate the computational complexity of the information retrieval process. In this work we focus on the scalability of our interpreter for dealing with massive XML files by making use of its ability for prematurely disregarding those computations leading to non significant solutions (i.e., with a poor degree of relevance according the preferences expressed by users when using the new command FILTER). Since our proposal has been implemented with a fuzzy logic language, here we exploit the high expressive resources of this declarative paradigm for performing “dynamic thresholding” in a very natural and efficient way, thus connecting with the so-called top-k answering problem, which is very well-known in the fuzzy logic and soft computing arena.<br><br>78.Jesús Manuel Almendros-Jiménez, Alejandro Luna-Tedesqui and Ginés Moreno.

MDE emphasizes the construction of models from which the implementation should be derived by applying model transformations. The Ontology Definition Meta-model (ODM) has been proposed as a profile for UML models of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). In this context, transformations of UML models can be mapped into ODM/OWL transformations. On the other hand, model validation is a crucial task in model transformation. Meta-modeling permits to give a syntactic structure to source and target models. However, semantic requirements have to be imposed on source and target models. A given transformation will be sound when source and target models fulfill the syntactic and semantic requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for model validation in ODM based transformations. Adopting a logic programming based transformational approach we will show how it is possible to transform and validate models. Properties to be validated range from structural and semantic requirements of models (pre and post conditions) to properties of the transformation (invariants). The approach has been applied to a well-known example of model transformation: the Entity-Relationship (ER) to Relational Model (RM) transformation.<br><br>70.Jesús M.

The encoding is based on the definition of for-let-where-return constructors by means of T OY functions, and uses the recently proposed XPath implementation for this language as a basis. XQuery expressions can be executed in T OY obtaining sequences of XML elements as answers. Our setting exploits the non-deterministic nature of T OY by retrieving the elements of the XML tree once at a time when necessary. We show that one of the advantages of using a rewriting-based language for implementing XQuery is that it can be used for optimizing XQuery expressions by query rewriting. With this aim, XQuery expressions are converted into higher order patterns that can be analyzed and modified by T OY functions.<br><br>61Jesús M. Almendros-Jiménez and Luis Iribarne.

Such system stores GML documents by means of the PostGIS RDBMS. In order to execute semantic-based XPath queries we have defined a translation of the queries into SQL. Such translation takes into account the GML schema. Finally, the system allows to visualize the result. With this aim, the result of a query is exported to the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format.  <br><br>47.Jesús M. Almendros Jiménez, José A. Piedra and Manuel Cantón.

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very ﬂexible text format derived from SGML. Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere. XPath language is the result of an eﬀort to provide address parts of an XML document. In support of this primary purpose, it becomes in a query language against an XML document. In this paper we present a proposal for the implementation of the XPath language in logic programming. With this aim we describe the representation of XML documents by means of a logic program. Rules and facts can be used for representing the document schema and the XML document itself. In particular, we will present how to index XML documents in logic programs: rules is supposed to be stored in main memory, however facts are stored in secondary memory by using two kind of indexes: one for each XML tag, and other for each group of terminal items. In addition, we study how to query by means of the XPath language against a logic program representing an XML document. It evolves the specialization of the logic program with regard to the XPath expression.

The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is considered as the format of choice for the exchange of information among various applications on the Internet. Since XML is emerging as a standard for data exchange, it is natural that queries among applications should be expressed as queries against data in XML format. This use gives rise to a requirement for a query language expressly designed for XML resources. World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) convened to create the XQuery language, concretely, a typed functional language for querying XML documents. One key aspect of the XQuery language is the use of the XPath language as basis for handling the structure of an XML document. In this paper, we present a proposal for the representation of XML documents by means of a logic program. Rules and facts can be used for representing the document schema and the XML document itself. In addition, we study how to query by means of the XPath language against a logic program representing an XML document. It evolves the specialization of the logic program with regard to the XPath expression. This specialization technique is based on the well-known transformation technique called Magic Sets and studied for deductive databases. The b ottom-up evaluation of the sp ecialized program is used for answering the query in the XPath language.<br><br>29.Antonio Corral and Jesús M.

Eﬃcient processing of distance-based queries (DBQs) is of great importance in spatial databases due to the wide area of applications that may address such queries. The most representative and known DBQs are the K Nearest Neighbors Query (KNNQ), q Distance Range Query (qDRQ), K Closest Pairs Query (KCPQ) and q Distance Join Query (qDJQ). In this paper, we propose new pruning mechanism to apply them in the design of new Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS) algorithms for DBQs between spatial objects indexed in R-trees. RBFS is a general search algorithm that runs in linear space and expands nodes in best-ﬁrst order, but it can suﬀer from node re-expansion overhead (i.e. to expand nodes in best-ﬁrst order, some nodes can be considered more than once). The R-tree and its variations are commonly cited spatial access methods that can be used for answering such spatial queries. Moreover, an exhaustive experimental study was also included using R-trees, which resulted to several conclusions about the eﬃciency of proposed RBFS algorithm and its com parison with respect to other search algorithms (Best-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Branch-and-Bound (DFBnB)), in terms of disk accesses, response time and main memory requirements, taking into account several important parameters as maximum branching factor (Cmax), cardinality of the ﬁnal query result (K), distance threshold (q) and size of a global LRU buﬀer (B). In general RBFS is competitive for KNNQ and KCPQ where the maximum branching factor (Cmax) is large enough (even better than DFBnB and very close to BFS), and it is a good alternative when we have main memory limitations in our computer due to high process overload in our system, since it is linear space consuming with respect to the height of the R-trees. Nevertheless, RBFS is the worst alternative for qDRQ and qDJQ. DFBnB is also a linear space algorithm and it obtains the same behavior as BFS for qDRQ and qDJQ; and it is the best when an LRU buﬀer was included. Finally, we have been able to check experimentally that BFS is the best for all DBQs, but it can consume many main memory resources to perform spatial queries.<br><br>28.Jesús Manuel Almendros Jiménez and Luis Iribarne.

It is based on the use of rewriting rules for defining of programs, and rewriting for goal solving. In this context, goals, usually, consist of equality (and, sometimes, inequality) constraints, which are solved in order to obtain answers, represented by means of substitutions. On the other hand, database programming languages involve a data model, a data definition language and, finally, a query language against the data defined according to the data model. To use functional logic programming as database programming language, (1) we will propose a data model involving the main features adopted from functional logic programming (for instance, handling of partial and infinite data), (2) we will use conditional rewriting rules as data definition language, and finally, (3) we will deal with equality and inequality constraints as query language. Moreover, as most database systems, (4) we will propose an extended relational calculus and algebra, which can be used as alternative query languages in this framework. Finally, (5) we will prove that three alternative query languages are equivalent.<br><br>23.Jesús Manuel Almendros Jiménez and Luis Iribarne. Describing Use Cases by means of Activity Diagrams.

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) supports a set of semantics and notation that addresses all scales of architectural complexity by using a MDD perspective. Use Cases and Activity Charts are two modeling techniques of the UML. The first one helps the designers to identify the requirements of the system discovering its high level functionality. The second one helps them to specify the internal behaviour of a certain entity or subsystem of the software developed, such as a database, a graphical interface, a software component, or any specific software. However, there is not a direct way to relate/model the requirements (use cases) with their internal behavior (activity charts). In this paper we present a method for describing use cases with activity charts. Our technique also allow us to identify the two main use case relationships ---include and generalization--- by means of activity charts. As a case study, we will show how to use the activity charts to describe graphical user interfaces (GUI) from use cases.

With this aim, we define a constraint system for handling spatial data types (points, lines, polygons and regions) and constraints on them (equalities and inequalities, memberships, metric, topological and structural constraints), and provide a suitable theory for this constraint system. The constraint solver is presented in the form of transformation rules. These transformation rules handle a special kind of constraints used for consistency checking, enabling an optimized and efficient solving of spatial constraints.<br><br>20.Jesús M.

CLP is described as a general schema of combination of logic-based languages and constraint solvers. Recently, a constraint system for the handling of constraints over sets of spatial objects has been presented. In this paper we study how to consider a CLP instance for this kind of constraints. In particular, we study the fixed-point and operational semantics of such instance. With respect to the operational semantics it is described how the constraint solver interacts with the mechanism of resolution, in particular how to detect failure branches by means of a consistence constraint checker and how to achieve constraint propagation and compute solved forms.<br><br>19.Jesús M.

Since XML is emerging as a standard for data exchange, it is natural that queries among applications should be expressed as queries against data in XML format. This use gives rise to a requirement for a query language designed expressly for XML resources. World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) convened to create the XQuery language, concretely, a typed functional language for querying XML documents. One key aspect of the XQuery language is the use of the XPath language as basis for handling of the structure of a XML document. In this paper we present a proposal for the representation of XML documents by means of a logic program. Rules and facts can be used for representing the document schema and the XML document itself. In addition, we study how to query by means of the XPath language against a logic program representing a XML document. It evolves the specialization of the logic program with regard to the XPath expression. This specialization technique is based on the well-known transformation technique called Magic Sets and studied for deductive databases. The bottom-up evaluation of the specialized program is used for answering the query in the XPath language.<br><br>18.Jesús M. Almendros Jiménez and Antonio Corral.

It relies on the application of standard (i.e., conventional) Discrete Mathematics, more precisely, it uses a fairly limited number of concepts from the fields of Linear Algebra and Sets Theory (hence its name, LAST). The use of LAST for data definition and query-answer are discussed in some detail, given the data-rich quality of Business IS and the fact that a solid data-model is therefore essential to their specification. The proposed approach implies integration with other semiformal specification methods, two of the possibilities being integration with UML-OCL and with the Entity-Relationship Model, which are discussed in this paper. Finally, mapping of LAST specifications to the Relational Model is also addressed; this possibility having an interest both, for (partial) implementation and for model simulation.<br><br>12.Jesús Manuel Almendros Jiménez and Antonio Becerra Terón.

The extended relational calculus is based on the relational first-order logic, by adding constraints in the form of equalities and disequalities over complex (partially defined and possibly infinite) values and interpreted functions. In addition, we propose the notion of safety over calculus formulas in order to guarantee the property of domain independence. In the case of the extended relational algebra, we provide a generalization of the selection and projection operators in order to restructure complex values by means of constructors and destructors, interpreted functions and function inverses, as well as, to consider equality and disequality constraints. Finally, we will state that the two query formalisms (calculus and algebra) are equivalent.<br><br>11.Jesús Manuel Almendros Jiménez, Antonio Becerra Terón and Jaime Sánchez Hernández.

This language consists of a specification of types, a set of type declarations for data constructors and functions and a set of constructor-based conditional rewriting rules including data and type conditions as constraints in the rule applicability. We have interested in type conditions that can be satisfiable (i.e. the satisfiability depends on the program rules and therefore it is not decidable statically) and make the program rules well-typed. The well-typedness of a program rule establishes that expressions occurring in it must be well-typed w.r.t. the type declarations and its type conditions. We present an algorithm that infers a minimal set of type conditions making well-typed a rule and that checks satisfiability of the type information provided by the user. This algorithm is shown to be sound and complete.<br><br>1.Jesús Manuel Almendros Jiménez, Ana Gil Luezas. Ishtar: A Functional Logic Language withPolymorphic Order Sorted Types. Extended Abstracts of the 10th International Workshop on Unification, UNIF'96, CIS-Bericht-96-91, pp. 76-81, University of Munich, 1996.[<a href="http://indalog.ual.es/WWW/unif96.ps">pdf</a>]<br><br>Abstract: This work investigates the integration of a polymorphic order-sorted type system into functional logic programming including lazy functions. Operational semantics for logic languages with polymorphic order-sorted types only requires type checking for data terms during the unification process. However, in lazy narrowing, type checking of expressions not being data terms could require evaluation. For this reason, a lazy type checking must be introduced and combined with lazy narrowing. We will define a lazy notion of type checking based on the type declarations, in such a way that the expressions involving function symbols will not be evaluated if the type declaration is enough to deduce the type.<br><br></include></p>
